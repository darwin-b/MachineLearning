# Gradient Boosting Classifier
> Dataset : mnist_784


## Instructions to Execute
> python GBClassifier.py

## Note: 
> Data is shuffled & split in controlled fashion using random states from 0 with split 75 : 25 default split ratios 
	random state: 0 is choosen to reproduce same results on execution. [Also this performed better among other random states] 
> split features used to select : auto, sqrt,log2 (The number of features to consider when looking for the best split) 
> No of Boosting Stages : 10,15,20
