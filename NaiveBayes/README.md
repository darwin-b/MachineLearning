# Assumptions
    Reading only Characters and words that are alphabets.  [A-Z,a-z]
        Also converting text in document to lower case.
        "cp437" Encoding used to read text.
        Ignoring numbers: as most of the numbers in documents refer either to time & date or line numbers/address.
        Ignoring special characters as well. [eg: ". / ' @ ....."]
