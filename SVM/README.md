# SVM
> Dataset : mnist_784


## Instructions to Execute
> python svmClassifier.py

## Note: 
> l2 regularisation paramter : .5, 1, 1.5, 2
> gamma : scale, auto for RBF Kernals
> max_terations : 50,100

Results with above combination of above parameters shall be displayed on terminal and 
pre-computed results screen shots can be found in results folder.
>> note: RBF & Polynomial kernels are computed with 100 iterations & to strike balance between execution & accuracy max iterations is reduced to 50.
